# Air Cargo Analysis – SQL Project

## 📘 Overview
This project analyzes air cargo–related data involving customers, routes, ticket details, and passengers.  
The objective is to organize, clean, and analyze data using SQL operations such as joins, filtering, subqueries, window functions, views, indexes, stored procedures, and execution plans.
